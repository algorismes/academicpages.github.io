**Abstract**: In this era, where a huge amount of information from different fields is gathered and
stored, its analysis and the extraction of value have become one of the most
attractive tasks for companies and society in general. The design of solutions for the
new questions emerged from data has required multidisciplinary teams. Computer
scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, biologists, journalists and sociologists, as
well as many others are now working together in order to provide knowledge from
data. This new interdisciplinary field is called data science.

You have no doubt already experienced data science inseveral forms. When you are looking for information onthe web by using a search engine or asking your mobilephone for directions, you are interacting with data scienceproducts. Data science has been behind resolving some ofour most common daily tasks for several years.Most of the scientific methods that power data scienceare not new and they have been out there, waiting forapplications to be developed, for a long time. Statisticsis an old science that stands on the shoulders of eigh-teenth century giants such as Pierre Simon Laplace (1749-1827) and Thomas Bayes (1701-1761). Machine learningis younger, but it has already moved beyond its infancyand can be considered a well-established discipline. Com-puter science changed our lives several decades ago andcontinues to do so; but it cannot be considered new.So, why is data science seen as a novel trend withinbusiness reviews, in technology blogs and at academicconferences?

So, why is data science seen as a novel trend withinbusiness reviews, in technology blogs and at academicconferences?The novelty of data science is not rooted in the latestscientific knowledge, but in a disruptive change in our so-ciety that has been caused by the evolution of technology:datification. Datification is the process of rendering intodata aspects of the world that have never been quantifiedbefore. At the personal level, the list of datified concepts is very long and still growing: business networks, thelists of books we are reading, the films we enjoy, the foodwe eat, our physical activity, our purchases, our driv-ing behavior, and so on. Even our thoughts are datifiedwhen we publish them on our favorite social network;and in a not so distant future, your gaze could be datifiedby wearable vision registering devices. At the businesslevel, companies are datifying semi-structured data thatwere previously discarded: web activity logs, computernetwork activity, machinery signals, etc. Non-structureddata, such as written reports, e-mails or voice recordings,are now being stored not only for archive purposes butalso to be analyzed.

However, datification is not the only ingredient of thedata science revolution. The other ingredient is the de-mocratization of data analysis. Large companies suchas Google, Yahoo, IBM or SAS were the only players inthis field when data science had no name. At the begin-ning of the century, the huge computational resourcesof those companies allowed them to take advantage ofdatification by using analytical techniques to develop in-novative products and even to take decisions about theirown business. Today, the analytical gap between thosecompanies and the rest of the world (companies and peo-ple) is shrinking. Access to cloud computing allows anyindividual to analyze huge amounts of data in short peri-ods of time. Analytical knowledge is free and most of thecrucial algorithms that are needed to create a solution canbe found, because open source development is the normin this field. As a result, the possibility of using rich datato take evidence-based decisions is open to virtually any person or company.

Data science is commonly defined as a methodologyby which to infer actionable insights from data. This is asubtle but important difference with respect to previousapproaches to data analysis, such as business intelligenceor exploratory statistics. Performing data science is a taskwith an ambitious objective: the production of beliefs informed by data and to be used as the basis of decisionmaking. In the absence of data, beliefs are uninformedand decisions, in the best of cases, are based on best prac-tices or intuition. The representation of complex environments by rich data opens up the possibility of applyingall the scientific knowledge we have regarding how toinfer knowledge from data.

In general, data science allows us to adopt four differ-ent strategies to explore the world using data:

  + Probing reality. Data can be gathered by passive or byactive methods. In the latter case, data represents theresponse of the world to our actions. Analysis of thoseresponses can be extremely valuable when it comes totaking decisions about our subsequent actions. Oneof the best examples of this strategy is the use of A/Btesting for web development: What is the best buttonsize and color? The best answer can only be found byprobing the world.

  + Pattern discovery. Divide and conquer is an old heuris-tic used to solve complex problems; but it is not alwayseasy to decide how to apply this common sense toproblems. Datified problems can be analyzed automat-ically to discover useful patterns and natural clustersthat can greatly simplify their solutions. The use of thistechnique to profile users is a critical ingredient todayin such important fields as programmatic advertising ordigital marketing.
