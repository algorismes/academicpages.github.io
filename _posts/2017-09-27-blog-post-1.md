In this era, where a huge amount of information from different fields is gathered and
stored, its analysis and the extraction of value have become one of the most
attractive tasks for companies and society in general. The design of solutions for the
new questions emerged from data has required multidisciplinary teams. Computer
scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, biologists, journalists and sociologists, as
well as many others are now working together in order to provide knowledge from
data. This new interdisciplinary field is called data science.
