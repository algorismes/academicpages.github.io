[MACHINE LEARNING WILL HELP COMPANIES AND ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE BETTER DECISIONS](https://bgsmath.cat/machine-learning-will-help-companies-administration-take-better-decisions/)


Jordi Vitrià is one of the authors of a new book on big data, deep learning, and artificial intelligence published as part of a 
series by National Geographic (first in Spanish, then in English and Italian). He makes the case to Penta readers that 
“Every human being must have the right to protect from other people’s eyes some aspects of his or her life that are perfectly legal.”
