In 2007, I joined the University of Barcelona (UB) as Full Professor, where I teach an introductory course on Algorithms and advanced courses on Data Mining and Collective Intelligence. From April 2011 to January 2016 I served as Head of the Applied Mathematics and Analysis Department, UB. Now, I am member of the new Mathematics & Computer Science Department at UB.

From 1991 to 2006, I taught Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the Computer Science Department at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). I have also been in charge of doctoral and master studies (until September 2007) at the Computer Science Department, UAB.

My research, when personal computers had 128KB of memory, was originally oriented towards digital image analysis and how to extract quantitative information from them, but soon evolved towards computer vision problems. After a postdoctoral year at the University of California at Berkeley in 1993, I focused on Bayesian methods for computer vision methods. Now, I am the head of a research group working in deep learning, computer vision and machine learning.

> **My research statement**
> To understand the fundamental processes underlying the visual perception of objects to derive new computer vision algorithms that, one day, may enable machines to see.

I have been always interested in connecting my academic work to its social environment, and since 1993 I have been involved in several projects to transfer academic knowledge to industrial production, medical diagnose and media applications.
