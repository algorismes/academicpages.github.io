Jordi Vitrià is a Full Professor the University of Barcelona (UB), which he joined in 2007, and where he teaches an introductory course on Algorithms and advanced courses on Data Science and Deep Learning. From April 2011 to January 2016 he served as UB'a Head of the Applied Mathematics and Analysis Department. He is now a member of the new Mathematics & Computer Science Department at UB. He is also the director of the Master in Foundations of Data Science and co-director of the Big Data and Data Science Postgraduate course at UB.

From 1991 to 2006, he taught Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the Computer Science Department at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). He was also in charge of doctoral and master studies in that department until September 2007.

He was one of the founding members of the Computer Vision Center (UAB), a non-profit research center with an independent legal status, established in 1995 by the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

His research, when personal computers had 128KB of memory, was originally oriented towards digital image analysis and how to extract quantitative information from them, but soon evolved towards computer vision problems. After a postdoctoral year at the University of California at Berkeley in 1993, he focused on Bayesian methods for computer vision methods. Now, he is leading a research group working in deep learning, computer vision and machine learning. He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed papers and holds 8 international patents. He has directed 14 PhD theses in the area of machine learning and computer vision. He has been the leader of a large number of research projects at international and national level.

He has been always interested in connecting his academic work to the local technological ecosystem, and since 1993 he has been involved in a large number of projects to transfer academic knowledge to industrial production, medical diagnoses and media applications. He is now director of the DataScience@UB group technology transfer group that is supported by the Generalitat de Catalunya (TECNIO Center). During the last years the DataScience@UB group has been actively collaborating with companies such as BBVA, IBM, TUV Rheinland, Telefonica, Vodafone, ICGC, Bodas.net, Given Imaging, correYvuela, Ajuntament de Barcelona, 7ideas, etc. He is currently involved in the organization of several events to to make Barcelona into the AI hub it has the potential to be, such BCN.AI, Open Data Barcelona, and Data Council Barcelona.
