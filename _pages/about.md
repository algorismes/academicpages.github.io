In 2007, Jordi Vitrià joined the University of Barcelona (UB) as Full Professor, where he teaches an introductory course on Algorithms and advanced courses on Data Science and Deep Learning. From April 2011 to January 2016 he served as Head of the Applied Mathematics and Analysis Department, UB. Now, he is member of the new Mathematics & Computer Science Department at UB. He is also Director of the [Master in Foundations of Data Science](http://www.ub.edu/datascience/master/) and co-director of the [Big Data and Data Science Postgraduate course](http://www.ub.edu/datascience/postgraduate) at the UB. 

From 1991 to 2006, He taught Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the Computer Science Department at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). He has also been in charge of doctoral and master studies (until September 2007) at the Computer Science Department, UAB.

His research, when personal computers had 128KB of memory, was originally oriented towards digital image analysis and how to extract quantitative information from them, but soon evolved towards computer vision problems. After a postdoctoral year at the University of California at Berkeley in 1993, he focused on Bayesian methods for computer vision methods. Now, he is leading a research group working in deep learning, computer vision and machine learning. He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed papers and 8 international patents. He has directed 12 PhD theses in the area of machine learning and computer vision. He has been the leader of a large number of research projects at international and national level.  

> **My research statement**
> To understand the fundamental processes underlying the visual perception of objects to derive new computer vision algorithms that, one day, may enable machines to see.

He has been always interested in connecting his academic work to the social environment, and since 1993 he has been involved in a large number of projects to transfer academic knowledge to industrial production, medical diagnose and media applications. He is now director of the [DataScience@UB group](http://datascience.barcelona/en) technology transfer group that is supported by the Generalitat de Catalunya. During the last years the DataScience@UB group has been actively collaborating with companies such as BBVA, IBM, TUV Rheinland, Telefonica, Vodafone, ICGC, Bodas.net, Given Imaging, correYvuela, Ajuntament de Barcelona, 7ideas, etc.
